The image above shows the prototype used to build this engine
This project is part of a series of hardware and functional upgrades I am developing to be applied to the 3D performer machines. I decided to put it as open source material as it is also a general-purpose application to manage linear or circular motion with stepper motors based on time instead of distance and number of steps.
The software also includes a series of controls buttons based on interrupts to learn how interrupts works as well.

## Hardware
### Arduino Mega 2560 as the main micro controller

### 24V 5A Stepper motor

### Moon's SR4 stepper motor controller (supporting microstepping)

### A custom circuit shield and some discrete components (buttons, LEDs, variable resistors etc.)
